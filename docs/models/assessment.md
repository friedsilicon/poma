# Nokia Router State Assessment

Analysis of what would be required to make the Nokia `nokia-state-router.yang` model pass validation.

## Current Status

The Nokia router state model currently **fails validation** due to missing dependencies. However, the Nokia BGP-specific models work perfectly:

- ✅ **Nokia BGP Submodule**: Fully functional
- ✅ **Nokia BGP Test Model**: Complete tree generation  
- ❌ **Nokia Router State**: Missing 70+ dependencies

## Issues Identified

### 1. Circular Dependencies

Router submodules (IGMP, LDP, MPLS, OSPF3, RSVP) create circular references to the main router module. This is a fundamental architectural issue in how Nokia structured these modules.

### 2. Missing Service Dependencies

Need **23+ service state modules** (`nokia-state-svc-*`):

- `nokia-state-svc-epipe`
- `nokia-state-svc-sdp` 
- `nokia-state-svc-vpls`
- `nokia-state-svc-vprn`
- Plus 19 additional service modules

Service modules have their own dependency chains, creating a cascade of requirements.

### 3. Missing Type Dependencies

Need **49+ type definition modules** (`nokia-types-*`):

- `nokia-types-filter`
- `nokia-types-eth-cfm`
- `nokia-types-l2tp`
- `nokia-types-ppp`
- Plus 45+ additional type modules

## Effort Analysis

### Minimal Approach (70+ files)

**What's needed:**
- Create symlinks for all 23 service state modules
- Create symlinks for ~25 additional type modules
- Add service and additional type paths to validation scripts

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

**Challenges:**
- Still leaves circular dependency issues
- May not fully resolve all validation errors
- Significant increase in repository complexity

### Complete Approach (100+ files)

**What's needed:**
- Create comprehensive Nokia module structure
- Handle circular dependency issues (may require module modifications)
- Create robust search path management
- Add ~100 additional symlinks

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

**Challenges:**
- Fundamental architectural issues requiring Nokia module modifications
- Complex interdependencies between modules
- Major increase in maintenance burden

## Recommendation

### ❌ Don't Pursue Full Router State Validation

**Reasons:**

1. **Scope Creep**: BGP focus would be diluted by adding 70+ non-BGP modules
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Fundamental architectural issues that may require Nokia module modifications
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Much larger symlink structure to maintain
4. **Current Success**: Nokia BGP submodule and BGP-only test model already work perfectly

### ✅ Keep BGP-Focused Approach

**Current success:**
- Nokia BGP submodule validation ✅
- Nokia BGP tree generation ✅  
- Complete BGP functionality testing ✅

The current setup already demonstrates that Nokia BGP models are functional and can generate complete YANG trees, which meets the primary goal for BGP modeling work.

## Alternative Solutions

If full router state validation becomes necessary in the future:

### Option 1: Vendor-Specific Branch
Create a separate branch with comprehensive Nokia dependencies for specialized use cases.

### Option 2: Docker Container
Package complete Nokia model environment in a container for isolated use.

### Option 3: Selective Dependencies
Add only the specific non-BGP protocols actually needed for particular use cases.

## Conclusion

The **BGP-focused approach is optimal** for current needs. The working Nokia BGP models provide all necessary functionality for BGP modeling work without the complexity and maintenance burden of full router state validation.
